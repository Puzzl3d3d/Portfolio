            I like to challenge and limit myself when developing every new project, so each time I can learn something new and grow my abilities. Examples are exploring a new game framework, making projects under a time limit (which I often do to maximise productivity)

                    Relatively successful game about cutting down trees inspired by Lumber Tycoon 1. Has near 8000 visits and 43 favourites, with over 4700 unique players. Entirely organic growth with *no* advertising *whatsoever*! Frequently updated for months adding lots of new content, but updates have slowed due to newer projects. So far its my best performing game and shows off some of my skills. The first version of the game was made in less than 2 hours.

                    My first attempt at a horror game, made in a few hours. Made to test my ability to mix audio and visuals to create a chilling environment and ability to keep players in suspense and to venture into a new category of game: Horror.

                    One of my first games that I was able to completely finish. Looks and feels completely like the original game, with all the rules and nuisances. This was the first game I was very proud of. This was also a fan favourite from many people I asked about at the time.

                    An on-going project attempting to emulate the style of Spelunky by Derek Yu, a game I was very fond of when I was younger. The cave generation took a few days to create, but with such a complex system with special rooms and enemies, it quickly turns into a very difficult task. I am still very proud of it's current state. I really put my programming skills and creativity into this project, even creating a python program to speed up the creation of game chunks, including a UI, saving and loading system.
