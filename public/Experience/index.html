                    My first relatively successful game about cutting down trees inspired by Lumber Tycoon 1. Has over 8500 visits and 48 favourites, with near 5400 unique players. Entirely organic growth with <i>no</i> advertising <i>whatsoever</i>! Frequently updated for months adding lots of new content, but updates have slowed due to newer projects. So far its my best performing game and shows off some of my skills. The first version of the game was made in less than 2 hours.

                    A multiplayer game inspired by Hypixel's Sumo Duels, Duels is a project which I started when I first got into scripting on Roblox. It was one of my first ideas for a game and occasionally I would work on it between projects. Definitely one of the more visually polished projects, with a lobby i made myself. Currently, I have a plan to make different gamemodes and a voting GUI which has been in development.

                    I have very high hopes for this game. Another on-going project but I'm building this game with the future in mind. Every script is adaptable to maximise the ability to add new things and refactor the old things. As far as I am aware, no Roblox game exists of this current nature, so this game will hope to fill a hole in the market. In the game, you collect resources from your Nation and use those resources to expand, develop and explore new areas on the map. Lots still needs to be done, but this game has potential.

                    An on-going project attempting to emulate the style of Spelunky by Derek Yu, a game I was very fond of when I was younger. The cave generation took a few days to create, but with such a complex system with special rooms and enemies, it quickly turns into a very difficult task. I am still very proud of it's current state. I really put my programming skills and creativity into this project, even creating a python program to speed up the creation of game chunks, including a UI, saving and loading system.
