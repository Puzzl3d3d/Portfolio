                    My first relatively successful game about cutting down trees inspired by Lumber Tycoon 1. Has over 8500 visits and 48 favourites, with near 5400 unique players. Entirely organic growth with <i>no</i> advertising <i>whatsoever</i>! Frequently updated for months adding lots of new content, but updates have slowed due to newer projects. So far its my best performing game and shows off some of my skills. The first version of the game was made in less than 2 hours.

                    My first attempt at a horror game, made in a few hours. Made to test my ability to mix audio and visuals to create a chilling environment and ability to keep players in suspense and to venture into a new category of game: Horror.

                    I have very high hopes for this game. Another on-going project but I'm building this game with the future in mind. Every script is adaptable to maximise the ability to add new things and refactor the old things. As far as I am aware, no Roblox game exists of this current nature, so this game will hope to fill a hole in the market. In the game, you collect resources from your Nation and use those resources to expand, develop and explore new areas on the map. Lots still needs to be done, but this game has potential.

                    One of my first games that I was able to completely finish. Looks and feels completely like the original game, with all the rules and nuisances. This was the first game I was very proud of. This was also a fan favourite from many people I asked about at the time.  It is mostly UI but plays and feels exactly like the original (based off the old design, reference video taken very recently), including all the colouring rules and even boasts a few new features, like skipping the wordle to the next one or spectating other people's games

                An on-going project attempting to emulate the style of Spelunky by Derek Yu, a game I was very fond of when I was younger. The cave generation took a few days to create, but with such a complex system with special rooms and enemies, it quickly turns into a very difficult task. I am still very proud of it's current state. I really put my programming skills and creativity into this project, even creating a python program to speed up the creation of game chunks, including a UI, saving and loading system.
